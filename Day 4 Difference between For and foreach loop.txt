For Loop:


It is a common loop that allows repetition of any operation. We can run any block of code any number of times till the condition is true.


Syntax:

for(i=0;i<=5;i++){

System.out.println(sum);

}


For each Loop:

It is used to retrieve the elements from Array or collections.

syntax:

for(datatype element : Arrayname){
System.out.println(element);
}

From the above description, It is clear that For each loop is easy to access all the elements of the array.
